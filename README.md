The food expiry checking app is a mobile application that helps users keep track of the expiration dates of the food items in their homes. The app has the following features:

Scan barcode: The app allows users to scan the barcode of the food item to automatically get the product information and expiration date.

Manual entry: If a product doesn't have a barcode or if the barcode is unreadable, the user can manually enter the product information and expiration date.

Expiration alerts: The app sends expiration alerts to the user before the food item expires so that they can use or discard it before it goes bad.

Inventory management: The app keeps track of the inventory of food items in the user's home, showing which items are about to expire and which items need to be restocked.

Recipe ideas: The app could provide recipe ideas based on the food items that are about to expire, to help users use up their food before it goes bad.

Overall, this app would help users reduce food waste and save money by providing them with a better understanding of the food items they have at home and when they need to be used or discarded.
